# FOPL, Spring 2018

This is the repository to store assignment packages for <i>Foundations of Programmming Languages</i> class at [USTC](http://www.ustc.edu.cn) in Spring 2018.

The packages are borrowed from [CS242: Programming Languages](http://cs242.stanford.edu/) at Stanford in Fall 2017 with a few modifications.
